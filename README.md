Design and write a Java program to read the file system beneath a particular folder,
and store it in a tree data structure.

Requirements:

    - Your program should be able to look at a folder and its tree of subfolders,
      and construct a tree data structure to represent it.
      Each node in your tree corresponds to a folder in the file system,
      and should contain the number of files, the total size of the files,
      the folder's name, and a list of child folders

    - Your program should read the name of the folder to scan, scan the folder's subtree,
      then output the tree in a way that shows the tree hierarchy
      (e.g., one line per tree node, and indent each node appropriately)

    - Hint: you should use recursion both in the scanning part of your program,
      and the part that outputs the tree
